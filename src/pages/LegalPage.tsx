  ['1. Data we collect', 'To run your account and bookings we collect your name, phone number, date of birth, gender (optional) and city. Your phone number is used to sign you in with a one-time password. If you add them, we also store your profile photo, username, bio and website link, the events you save and the friend groups you create. We keep a record of your bookings and payments. We keep a list of the devices signed in to your account (device type, IP address and last active time) so you can review and sign them out. If you register a venue, we also collect what we need to list your events and pay you: business name and type, contact person, phone, email, registered address, PAN, GST number, bank account details, logo and venue photos. The payment and QR-scanning components in the app send basic device and diagnostic information to their providers (Razorpay and Google) so they work reliably. App Lock uses your phone\'s own fingerprint or face check; Entrava never receives biometric data. We only collect what is necessary to perform our service.'],
  ['2. Use of contacts', "If you choose to use the Friends feature, we ask permission to access your contacts. Before that permission is requested, the app explains what happens.\n\nWhat actually happens: your contacts' phone numbers are sent to our servers so we can check which of them are already registered on Entrava. Contact names stay on your device. We do not store your address book, and we do not share it with venues, advertisers or anyone else. The check is only ever run against numbers already in your phone.\n\nYou can decline, and Entrava works normally without it."],
  ['3. Sharing plans with friends', 'After a successful booking, you can choose whether accepted Entrava friends may see that you are going to the event. This is off by default and controlled separately for each booking. Friends see your name and the public event details only. They never see your booking ID, QR code, guest names, ticket type, price or payment status. You can turn sharing off, and the plan stops appearing after the event date.'],
  ['4. Push notifications', 'If you allow notifications, we store a device notification token so Entrava can tell you when your venue KYC is approved, when you receive a friend request, or when a friend accepts your request. You can turn notifications off in your phone settings. We remove the token from your account when you log out on that device.'],
  ['5. Your rights', 'Under the DPDPA 2023 you have the right to access, correct or erase your data, and to withdraw consent at any time. You can delete your account from inside the app (Profile > Delete Account) or request deletion at entrava.app/delete-account.'],
  ['6. Data sharing', 'We share your name and booking details with the venue you booked with, so they can verify your entry. Payments are processed by Razorpay, who receive the payment information needed to complete the transaction. Venue business, tax and bank details are shared with Razorpay to verify the venue and send its payouts. Booking alerts may be sent over WhatsApp, and account or social alerts may be sent as app notifications when you allow them. We do not sell your personal data.'],
  ['7. Data retention', 'When you delete your account, your personal details are erased. Booking records are retained in an anonymised form because they are financial records tied to payments already made, and venues need them for their guest lists.'],
  ['8. Children', 'Entrava is strictly for users aged 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 18.'],

      ['2. Booking and payment', 'The full price and Entrava platform fee are shown before payment. You must provide accurate booking details and use a payment method you are authorised to use.'],
      ['3. Age and admission', 'Entrava is for people aged 18 or over. A booking does not override a venue\'s legal age checks, identification requirements, dress code or safety rules.'],
      ['4. Friends and split payments', 'Only add people you know. Each participant is responsible for their own share. A split booking is confirmed only when all required shares are paid before the deadline shown in the app.'],

To protect you, we confirm the request with a one-time code sent on WhatsApp to that number before deleting anything. We complete verified requests within 30 days and email you when it is done.'],

Anyone you split a table with will see you as a deleted account.'],
      ['What we keep, and why', 'Booking and payment records are kept in anonymised form, with your personal details removed, because they are financial records of payments already made and Indian tax and accounting law requires us to keep them. Venues keep the guest-list entries for bookings that have already happened.'],
      ['Venue accounts', 'If you own a venue on Entrava, deleting your account also removes the venue from the app, stops new bookings for its events and erases its contact and bank details. Tickets already sold for upcoming events stay valid at the door.'],
      ['Taking a break instead', 'If you only want to disappear for a while, use Profile > Privacy > Deactivate account instead. Friends cannot find you or see your plans while you are deactivated, nothing is deleted, and logging back in reactivates your account.'],
